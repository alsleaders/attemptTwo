        I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to
        Heathrow airport. Geronimo! A straight line may be the shortest distance
        between two points, but it is by no means the most interesting. Grace, I
        came back to life before your eyes. I held back death. Look, I can't
        make your dream come true forever, but I can make it come true today.
        No… No-no-no-no-wait-wait-wait-wait… I remember I'm-I-I… I'm with my
        father, we're lying back in the grass, it's a warm Gallifreyan night—
