          Nice to meet you, Rose. Rose... before I go, I just want to tell you:
          you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And do you know what? So was
          I! Run. Ricky, if I was to tell you what I was doing to the controls
          of my frankly magnificent timeship, would you even begin to
          understand? And I'm looking for a blonde in a Union Jack. A specific
          one, mind, I didn't just wake up this morning with a craving. Yeah, I
          came first in jiggery pokery, what about you? Do you wanna come with
          me? 'Cause if you do, then I should warn you â€” you're gonna see all
          sorts of things. Ghosts from the past. Aliens from the future. The day
          the Earth died in a ball of flame. It won't be quiet, it won't be
          safe, and it won't be calm. But I'll tell you what it will be: The
          trip of a lifetime!
        </p>
