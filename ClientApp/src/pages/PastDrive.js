        The past is another country. 1987's just the Isle of Wight. Two wrongs
        don't make a left turn. Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like
        that? They're scientific instruments, not water pistols. It's all right
        up to the eyebrows. Then it goes haywire. I don't like it. People assume
        that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually,
        from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball
        of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. Blimey, trying to make an Ood
        laugh...
